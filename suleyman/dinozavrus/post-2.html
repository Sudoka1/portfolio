    <p><b>Scotty</b> is the nickname for the Tyrannosaurus rex fossil, catalogued as RSM P2523.8, that was discovered in Saskatchewan, Canada in 1991. The fossilised remains were painstakingly removed, almost completely by hand, over two decades from the rock in which they were embedded.[1] When the preparation was complete in 2011, a ~65% complete T. rex skeleton was revealed.[2]

        Since its discovery and extensive subsequent study, Scotty has been referred to as the largest T. rex ever discovered in the world, the largest of any dinosaur discovered in Canada, and as one of the oldest and most complete fossils of its kind at more than 70% bulk.[3]
        
        Scotty resides at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum's T. rex Discovery Centre in Eastend, Saskatchewan, Canada. In May 2019, a second mount was erected at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in Regina, where the exhibit reflects the recent discoveries about the fossil.[4]
        
        Discovery
        Scotty was discovered by Robert Gebhardt, a high school principal from Eastend, Saskatchewan, who accompanied a team of palaeontologists from the Royal Saskatchewan Museum (RSM) on a prospective expedition into the Frenchman Formation alongside the Frenchman River Valley in southwestern Saskatchewan on 16 August 1991.[3][5][6] Although he was only there to learn how to find and identify fossils, Gebhardt uncovered a tooth and tail vertebra that the museum was able to verify belonged to a T. rex.[7] Initially, Gebhardt thought that the visible fossil was actually ironstone.[7]
        
        It wasn't until June 1994 that the Royal Saskatchewan Museum was able to begin the excavation, which was led and overseen by the Museum's Ron Borden, as well as resident palaeontologists Tim Tokaryk and John Storer who were with Gebhardt when he uncovered the first fossils.[4][7] The bones were deeply packed in dense, iron-laden sandstone, which took more than twenty years for the team to fully remove, excavate, and assemble the majority of the skeleton, with additional trips being made to the site to retrieve smaller bones and teeth.[7][8][9][10] The entire process of excavating the skeleton was also slowed down by its considerable size.[3]
        
        The first fossils unearthed were part of the upper body, specifically vertebra, parts of the jaw, and teeth. At the time of its discovery, the fossil was one of only 12 known T. rex skeletons of significant completion.[3] The name "Scotty" came from the celebratory bottle of scotch shared by the team that had discovered and identified the bones.[11] Alongside the fossil was also found the only known T. rex coprolite in the world.[12]</p>
